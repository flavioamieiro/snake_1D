It's always there, but you'll need a strip of ws2812b LEDs to see and interact with it.

Here, you'll find two species: The [python](fadecandy_python/#readme),
for which you'll need a computer and a
[fadecandy](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy) and the
[tiny](attiny85_arduino_IDE/#readme), for which you can use the
standalone [hardware](hardware/#readme).
